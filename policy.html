        <p class="p">This Website may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, that allow us to count users who
            have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional
            e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Some
            of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of
            our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers
            to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer
            each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page
            views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you
